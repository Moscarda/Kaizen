simple-wixel-starter-framework
==============================

a Simple-as-possible responsive Sass starter framework.

###Why?
Simple. Frameworks are way to big and starting a project from scratch takes too long.

###What?
It's a bare basics framework, it's meant to be hacked, modified and not at all a dependancy yet sets a very organised platform to build upon.

###Includes
* Box-sizing reset.
* Simple easy to understand file structure.
* a Mobile first 12 column responsive grid.
* Typography reset with helpers and easily configurable settings.
* Color settings.

Get really Sassy with [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) and keep your naughty friends inline with [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) (This framework loves both)

###Installation
Just drop the files in your Sass folder and either use the main.scss file as your main sass file or copy it's content into the top of your current stylesheet.

###Using the typography
Very simple, configure the values in the _base.scss file

###Using the grid
The grid borrows the same naming convention as the foundation framework.
